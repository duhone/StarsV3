    explained below.

     1. Enable Planets
	When checked you will periodically slow down and pass very close to
	a planet for a close up look.
	Enabling will slightly decrease performance.

     2. Speed
	Will control how fast you move through the stars.
	Does not have any impact on performance.

     3. Starfield Density
	Controls the number of stars drawn on the screen. The numbers of stars
	are as follows.
	  Low Density - 2000 stars
	  Medium Density - 5000 stars
	  High Density - 10000 stars
	Having more stars will severely impact the performance.

	than this without this checked.
